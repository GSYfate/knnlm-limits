{"label": "1", "text": "the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an \" auto \" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "the camera was a marvel ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it is versatile and seems to be one of the best ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the met 60 ct-4 ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "but at least you re starting with the most photo realistic images ive ever seen from a camera ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k . reeves ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the service from the supplier was exceptional ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stop action photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the camera is a dream to operate in auto mode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "but canon never fails to amaze ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "2 . battery life is over 4 . 5 hours , compared to about 2 . 5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikon's ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "3 . the remote capture and file viewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the light auto-correction is awesome ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "this is quite simply the best you can ask for ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! . )"}
{"label": "1", "text": "the powershot g3 is a great camera ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos ! ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "i love the quality of the pictures ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "they look fantastic ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "i love the es based controls and easy menus ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i bought it for my trip to buns aries , and also used it at the iguassu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it ! ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "also , the display is \" hinged \" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i have owned this camera for a short time and would n 't give it up for anything ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera . ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "in general it is easy to use and well laid out ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "in the hands of someone who does n 't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ; ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "and so far , i 've been very pleased ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the moveable lcd screen is great ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :"}
{"label": "1", "text": "i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :"}
{"label": "1", "text": "the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperture priority , light metering adjustments , etc . , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "i have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode , while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera , its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe ( max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card ) ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "audio is mono and fairly acceptable , quiet also with little distortions ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "i purchased the elph s100 mainly because i thought it was cool ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great ( not as good as prints from my pro digital camera , but still very good ) ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "this camera is so light and tiny that i literally carry it everywhere with me , which is great considering i 'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the software that comes with the digital elph is very nice and intuitive ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the photostitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "other than that , i love this camera ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "the good : small size ; . durable-seeming metal case ; . easy to use ; . visually distinctive ; . good picture quality ; . fast usb connection ; . mostly intuitive operation ; . really cool photostitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "if compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera , the canon powershot s100 digital elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the s100 's image quality rates in the middle of its class , but it can still be a reasonable choice for students , families , or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i purchased this camera before it went on sale , and while i wouldn 't have minded keeping the extra $$$ , it was definitely worth it ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "i just went on a quick photo shoot in nyc 's central park today , and what a bunch of beautiful photos i took , if i do say so myself ( and i do ! . )"}
{"label": "1", "text": "the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot , and with instant review on the lcd screen , you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "i also had no problems installing or running the camera software on my pc ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "the panorama modes are wonderful ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "after getting one for christmas from amazon , i 'm now a believer : the digital elph is truly the world 's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "i , as many others , have waited for many years for the convergence of price , features , size and ease of use to hit that happy center point ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i bought this little guy a few weeks back , and i have to say that i never had so much fun with a new toy as this ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "you indefinitely appreciate the small size ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the software is great ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "transfering is easy , the software makes everything pretty easy ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "software is easy to use ( although red hat software is better , but costs money )"}
{"label": "1", "text": "much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n 't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate"}
{"label": "1", "text": "the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well re cored mp3s ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "so far the software for the pc works easily ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "by the way , it looks nice also ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it 's worth it ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "other plusses : changeable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "( batteries last longer too ! . )"}

{"label": "1", "text": "i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n 't blind you when you stare too long ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i have n 't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "other than that this thing is great . . ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "all the buttons & necessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the sound quality is also nice . . . after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^"}
{"label": "1", "text": "another plus in my book , no file limits ! ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "i 've had no problems with the software ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i found it intuitive to use ( i did n 't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "this is a nice feature ( i . e . it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to \" easy listening \" rather than \" heavy metal \" - no problem ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "for the price and features it is really good ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n 't wash my car ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a hard drive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "- uploading music is quick and easy ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "- equipment included is average , but that is n 't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; . a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibels , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the software has n 't been a hassle for me at all ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "lastly , the price is fantastic :"}
{"label": "1", "text": "i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "usb 2 . 0 - very fast"}
{"label": "1", "text": "but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "and for those that are int rested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ) ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i am very pleased so far ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "very simple to use ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "all in all suprisingly easy to use ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "having usb 2 . 0 makes for very fast transfers ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the buttons and interface are very easy to use ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the battery life seems good , takes very little time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i have n 't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i would recommend this product to anyone ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n 't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n 't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n 't take up space on your pc hard drive ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the software could n 't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n 't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it is an extremely cool cozmo ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it hasn't gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ) ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "oh . . . and file transfers are fast & easy ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it 's easy ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "its really cool ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "sound quality is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "also , you can store data on it , which is a plus . for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n 't bother , this is a much better buy ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good . . ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the storage capacity is great for me --"}
{"label": "1", "text": "the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "second , the \" automatic \" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it also lets you remove songs from the play order ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "this did n 't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it comes with a good case that fits it snugly ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "extremely convenient ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "great price ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i thought the software was decent enough - it was n 't complicated to learn at all ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i 'm really happy with this purchase ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "now he res the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equalizer type deals on here ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything . . . good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "* price and capacity"}
{"label": "1", "text": "* slick-looking design and improved interface"}
{"label": "1", "text": "* removable battery"}
{"label": "1", "text": "despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; . this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57 , 000 mb of free memory available to me ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 . 0 ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "ripping the songs , even with my 1 . 1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n 't be easier to use ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "and with usb 2 . 0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "1 . i achieved my basic objective ; . my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; . when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; . if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n 't even notice the click ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; . it does n 't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12 . 5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i did n 't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit"}

{"label": "1", "text": "i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra . . . and i was not disappointed ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice verse ) was easy too ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the price / performance looked just right ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "4 ) usb 2 . 0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! . ) ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows media player , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cb service ( gracenotes ) ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i do n 't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "b . fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2 . 4 hz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "c . i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc . , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player"}
{"label": "1", "text": "12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "great sound ; . good interface ; . replaceable , powerful battery ; . good software ; . wake-up , sleep timers ; . multiple play modes"}
{"label": "1", "text": "can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "also love waking up to music with attached speakers ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www . ipod's dirty secret . com ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n 't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "fact is , it could n 't be easier to use ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "usb 2 . 0 transfer is insanely fast ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "my first impression was positive ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "overall , a good buy for the price ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumb wheel scroll / push button ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery"}
{"label": "1", "text": "reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i bought the player this week and i like it by far ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "value : comparing data storage with price ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the appearance is okay ed ( at least not ugly ) ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )"}
{"label": "1", "text": "easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this"}
{"label": "1", "text": "the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly"}
{"label": "1", "text": "huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on your sound quality , the sound might crack ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of \" now playing \" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "and also , it 's priced very afford ably ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "with 40gb of storage i have about 7 , 500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2 , 500 more ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's \" notmad \" software because of some advanced features i wanted ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n 't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , rivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "price ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "have had the player since xmas's and love it ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n 't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the screen 's large and easily read ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "interface - practically seamless ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it was no problem for me to use their software ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "honestly , i love this player ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the sound quality is very good ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "works great , no odor , and uses regular bags ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "so far ( 3 weeks ) , we 've had no problems with the diaper champ at all ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it contains the smell from our baby 's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i don 't know if we 'll run into trouble down the road with odors , but so far i have no complaints and i 'm very happy not to have to buy those refills ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the diaper champ is the best we found ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "there are no spec ail bags to deal with or buy ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "we use the cheap $1 . 99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and it 's fairly inexpensive as baby products go ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i love that you don 't have to purchase expensive refills ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "if i had to do it over again , even with the cost savings of using any type of bag , i would go w/ the diaper genie ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it 's far better than all others on the market ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it 's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn 't have clumsy and confusing ( not to mention expensive ) refills ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "there is no odor and extremely easy to use ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "1 . it uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "3 . it never smelled - at all ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the container is hard to open , which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler , and you do have to flip the handle carefully ( which has saved more than a few of her toys , too . ) i don 't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "this is a must have product for all new moms ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it is much easier to fill and unload than the diaper genie , plus , why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the dollar store ? ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it also holds a lot more diapers ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "look at the size of it ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i highly recommend this ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i have to say that i am very happy with it so far ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i am happy with the fact that i can use any bag in there and dont ' have to pay out the nose for replacements ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "it 's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the bags attach inside the champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "i bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and i absolutely love it ! ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "the diaper champ couldn 't be easier to use ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "and the biggest plus is that you don 't have to buy any expensive refills ."}
